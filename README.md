## How to run this app

### First, start the Redis server

- Depend on your type of system, you can find the instruction how to locally start the Redis Server [here](https://redis.io/docs/getting-started/)

### Open terminal in the root directory of the project where the `index.js` is located and type:

```
npm start
```
